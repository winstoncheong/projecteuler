# 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

**Solution:** Trivial.

# 2: Even Fibonacci numbers
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**Solution:** Trivial.

# 3: Largest prime factor
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

**Solution:** Trivial.

# 4: Largest palindrome product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

**Solution:** Created a `is_palindrome()` function. Determined a way to traverse the grid by diagonals, so that the largest product shows up first.


# 5: Smallest multiple
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

**Solution:** Mathematically, this is just asking for the LCM of the numbers 1,...,20. 

# 6: Sum square difference
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
$$1^2+2^2+\cdots+10^2 = 385$$

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
$$(1+2+\cdots+10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025$$

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025-385=2640$

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

**Solution:** Used closed-form formula for sum-of-squares and for triangular numbers.

# 7: 10001st prime
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10001st prime number?

**Solution:** Can just ask WolframAlpha `prime[10001]`. But to code it, created a list of primes that continued to be appended to until reached length 10001.

# 8: Largest product in a series

The four adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product are 9 × 9 × 8 × 9 = 5832.

Find the thirteen adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product. What is the value of this product?

**Solution:** Iterated through string, producting length-13 substrings. Turned them into lists of 13 ints, and then producted all them together using `reduce` and `mul` in the `operator` package. Stored all these products in a list, and applied `max` to get the result.

# 9: Special Pythagorean triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
For example, $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2$.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

**Solution:** Just a double for loop, with smart cutoffs.

# 10: Summation of primes
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

**Solution:** WolframAlpha will just tell you. But to code it, I used Eratosthenes's sieve technique. Only need to sieve up to $\sqrt{2,000,000} \approx 1415$. Needed a bit of logic to make sure the loop exited correctly.

The product of these numbers is 26 × 63 × 78 × 14 = 1788696.

What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 20×20 grid?

**Solution:** Just grid traversal. Multiple double-for loops to get every arrangement of 4 adjacent numbers. Had to be careful with indexing / range of the looping.

# 12: Highly divisible triangular number
What is the value of the first triangle number to have over 500 divisors?

**Solution:** Calculate number of divisors by using the factorization of the number (from the powers of the primes). 

# 13: Large sum

Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers.

**Solution:** Trivial. Just add everything.

# 14: Longest Collatz sequence
The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

> n → n/2 (n is even)
> 
> n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:

<center>
13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
</center>

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

**NOTE:** Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

**Solution:** Did it the naive way. Keep track of the current max value and its length.

# 15: Lattice paths

Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

![Paths](assets/p015.png)

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

**Solution:** Mathematically, this is just $\binom{40}{20}$, since you are choosing 20 locations out of 40 to go right, the rest, you go down.

# 16: Power digit sum
$2^{15} = 32768$ and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.

What is the sum of the digits of the number $2^{1000}$?

**Solution:** Trivial

# 17: Number letter counts
If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?


**NOTE:** Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

**Solution:** Created a dictionary to convert numbers to english. 

# 18: Maximum path sum I
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

<pre style="text-align:center">
<span style="color:red">3</span>
<span style="color:red">7</span> 4
2 <span style="color:red">4</span> 6
8 5 <span style="color:red">9</span> 3
</pre>

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

<pre style="text-align:center">
75
95 64
17 47 82
18 35 87 10
20 04 82 47 65

04 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23
</pre>

**NOTE:** As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)

**Solution:** Created a consuming function from the bottom. 


# 19: Counting Sundays (TODO)

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

# 20: Factorial digit sum

Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

**Solution:** Trivial. Created two utility functions: `sum_of_digits` and `factorial`. 

# 21: Amicable numbers (TODO)

Let $d(n)$ be the sum of proper divisors of $n$. If $d(a) = b$ and $d(b) = a$, where $a\ne b$, then $a$ and $b$ are an amicable pair and each of $a$ and $b$ are called amicable numbers. For example, 220 and 284.

Evaluate the sum of all amicable numbers under 10000.

# 22: Name scores (TODO)
Using `p022_names.txt`, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

# 23: Nonabundant sums (TODO)
A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.

A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

# 24: Lexicographic permutations (TODO)
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

<center><pre>012   021   102   120   201   210</pre></center>

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

# 25: 1000-digit Fibonacci number (TODO)
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

$F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}$, where $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$.
Hence the first 12 terms will be:

    F_1 = 1
    F_2 = 1
    F_3 = 2
    F_4 = 3
    F_5 = 5
    F_6 = 8
    F_7 = 13
    F_8 = 21
    F_9 = 34
    F_10 = 55
    F_11 = 89
    F_12 = 144

The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?

# 26: Reciprocal cycles (TODO)
A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

<pre>
1/2	= 	0.5
1/3	= 	0.(3)
1/4	= 	0.25
1/5	= 	0.2
1/6	= 	0.1(6)
1/7	= 	0.(142857)
1/8	= 	0.125
1/9	= 	0.(1)
1/10	= 	0.1
</pre>

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

# 27: Quadratic primes (TODO)
Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
$$n^2+n+41$$

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values $0\le n \le 39$. However, when n=40, $40^2+40+41 = 40(40+1) + 41$ is divisible by 41, and certainly when $n=41$, $41^2+41+41$ is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula $n^2-79n+1601$ was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values $0\le n \le 79$. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:

$n^2+an+b$, where $|a| < 1000$  and  $|b| \le 1000$

where $|n|$ is the modulus/absolute value of n.

Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n=0.

# 28: Number spiral diagonals (TODO)
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

<center>
<pre>
<span class="red">21</span> 22 23 24 <span class="red">25</span>
20  <span class="red">7</span>  8  <span class="red">9</span> 10
19  6  <span class="red">1</span>  2 11
18  <span class="red">5</span>  4  <span class="red">3</span> 12
<span class="red">17</span> 16 15 14 <span class="red">13</span>
</pre>
</center>

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?

# 29: Distinct powers (TODO)
Consider all integer combinations of a^b for 2 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 5:

> 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32
> 
> 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243
> 
> 4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, 4^5=1024
> 
> 5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

    4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by a^b for 2 ≤ a ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 100?

# 30: Digit fifth powers (TODO)

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

> 1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
> 
> 8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
> 
> 9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4

As 1 = 1^4 is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

# 31: Coin sums (TODO)
In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:

    1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

    1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

# 32: Pandigital products (TODO)
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 × 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

**HINT:** Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

# 33: Digit cancelling fractions (TODO)
The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.

We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.

There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.

# 34: Digit factorials (TODO)
145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

Note: As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

# 35: Circular primes (TODO)
The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

How many circular primes are there below one million?

# 36: Double-base palindromes (TODO)
The decimal number, 585 = 10010010012 (binary), is palindromic in both bases.

Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.

(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)

# 37: Truncatable primes (TODO)
The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.

NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.

# 38: Pandigital multiples (TODO)
Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

> 192 × 1 = 192
> 
> 192 × 2 = 384
> 
> 192 × 3 = 576

By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)

The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).

What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?

# 39: Integer right triangles (TODO)
If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

    {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p ≤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

# 40: Champernowne's constant (TODO)
An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

> 0.12345678910<span class='red'>1</span>112131415161718192021...

It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.

If d_n represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.

> d_1 × d_10 × d_100 × d_1000 × d_10000 × d_100000 × d_1000000

# 41: Pandigital prime (TODO)
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime.

What is the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists?

# 42: Coded triangle numbers (TODO)
The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = ½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using `p042_words.txt`, a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?

# 43: Sub-string divisibility (TODO)
The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.

Let d_1 be the 1st digit, d_2 be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:

* d_2 d_3 d_4=406 is divisible by 2
* d_3 d_4 d_5=063 is divisible by 3
* d_4 d_5 d_6=635 is divisible by 5
* d_5 d_6 d_7=357 is divisible by 7
* d_6 d_7 d_8=572 is divisible by 11
* d_7 d_8 d_9=728 is divisible by 13
* d_8 d_9 d_10=289 is divisible by 17

Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.

# 44: Pentagonal numbers (TODO)
Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, $P_n = n(3n−1)/2$. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

> 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that P_4 + P_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P_8. However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P_j and P_k, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |P_k − P_j| is minimised; what is the value of D?

# 45: Triangular, pentagonal, hexagonal (TODO)
Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

|type|formula|vals|
|----|-------|----|
|Triangle|T_n=n(n+1)/2|1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...|
|Pentagonal|P_n=n(3n−1)/2|1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...|
|Hexagonal|H_n=n(2n−1)|1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...|

It can be verified that T_285 = P_165 = H_143 = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

# 46: Goldbach's other conjecture (TODO)
It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

> 9 = 7 + 2×1^2
> 
> 15 = 7 + 2×2^2
> 
> 21 = 3 + 2×3^2
> 
> 25 = 7 + 2×3^2
> 
> 27 = 19 + 2×2^2
> 
> 33 = 31 + 2×1^2

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?

# 47: Distinct prime factors (TODO)

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

* 14 = 2 × 7
* 15 = 3 × 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

* 644 = 2² × 7 × 23
* 645 = 3 × 5 × 43
* 646 = 2 × 17 × 19.

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?

# 48: Self powers (TODO)
The series, 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 10^10 = 10405071317.

Find the last ten digits of the series, 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 1000^1000.

# 49: Prime permutations (TODO)
The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.

There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.

What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?

# 50: Consecutive prime sum (TODO)
The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:

> 41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13

This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.

The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.

Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?

# 51: Prime digit replacements (TODO)
By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out that six of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.

By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this property.

Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family.

# 52: Permuted multiples (TODO)
It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748, contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order.

Find the smallest positive integer, x, such that 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x, contain the same digits.

# 53: Combinatoric selections (TODO)
There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

> 123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, $\displaystyle \binom 5 3 = 10$.

In general, $\displaystyle \binom n r = \dfrac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $r \le n$, $n! = n \times (n-1) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$, and $0! = 1$.

It is not until $n = 23$, that a value exceeds one-million: $\displaystyle \binom{23}{10} = 1144066$.
How many, not necessarily distinct, values of $\displaystyle \binom n r$ for $1 \le n \le 100$, are greater than one-million?

# 54: Poker hands (TODO)
In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:

* **High Card**: Highest value card.
* **One Pair**: Two cards of the same value.
* **Two Pairs**: Two different pairs.
* **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same value.
* **Straight**: All cards are consecutive values.
* **Flush**: All cards of the same suit.
* **Full House**: Three of a kind and a pair.
* **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same value.
* **Straight Flush**: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
* **Royal Flush**: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.

The cards are valued in the order:
> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.

If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.

Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:

<div class="center">
<table><tr><td><b>Hand</b></td><td> </td><td><b>Player 1</b></td><td> </td><td><b>Player 2</b></td><td> </td><td><b>Winner</b></td>
</tr><tr><td><b>1</b></td><td> </td><td>5H 5C 6S 7S KD<br /><div class="smaller">Pair of Fives</div></td><td> </td><td>2C 3S 8S 8D TD<br /><div class="smaller">Pair of Eights</div></td><td> </td><td>Player 2</td>

</tr></table></div>

The file `p054_poker.txt` contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there is a clear winner.<

How many hands does Player 1 win?

# 55: Lychrel numbers (TODO)
If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.

Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,

> 349 + 943 = 1292,
> 
> 1292 + 2921 = 4213
> 
> 4213 + 3124 = 7337

That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.

Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).

Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.

How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?

NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.

# 56: Powerful digit sum (TODO)
A googol (10^100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100^100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, ab, where a, b < 100, what is the maximum digital sum?

# 57: Square root convergents (TODO)
It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.

$$\sqrt 2 =1+ \frac 1 {2+ \frac 1 {2 +\frac 1 {2+ \dots}}}$$

By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:
* $1 + \frac 1 2 = \frac  32 = 1.5$
* $1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 2} = \frac 7 5 = 1.4$
* $1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}} = \frac {17}{12} = 1.41666 \dots$
* $1 + \frac 1 {2 + \frac 1 {2+\frac 1 {2+\frac 1 2}}} = \frac {41}{29} = 1.41379 \dots$

The next three expansions are $\frac {99}{70}$, $\frac {239}{169}$, and $\frac {577}{408}$, but the eighth expansion, $\frac {1393}{985}$, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.

In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?

# 58: Spiral primes (TODO)
Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

<pre>
<span class="red"><b>37</b></span> 36 35 34 33 32 <span class="red"><b>31</b></span>
38 <span class="red"><b>17</b></span> 16 15 14 <span class="red"><b>13</b></span> 30
39 18 <span class="red"> <b>5</b></span>  4 <span class="red"> <b>3</b></span> 12 29

42 21 22 23 24 25 26
<span class="red"><b>43</b></span> 44 45 46 47 48 49
</pre>

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 ≈ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

# 59: XOR decryption (TODO)
Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.

A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.

For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.

Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.

Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using `p059_cipher.txt`, a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.

# 60: Prime pair sets (TODO)
The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. By taking any two primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be prime. For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The sum of these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes with this property.

Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes concatenate to produce another prime.

# Cyclical figurate numbers (TODO)
Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal numbers are all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the following formulae:

|shape|formula|seq|
|-----|-------|---|
|Triangle|P_{3,n}=n(n+1)/2|1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...|
|Square|P_{4,n}=n^2|1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...|
|Pentagonal|P_{5,n}=n(3n−1)/2|1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...|
|Hexagonal|P_{6,n}=n(2n−1)|1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...|
|Heptagonal|P_{7,n}=n(5n−3)/2|1, 7, 18, 34, 55, ...|
|Octagonal|P_{8,n}=n(3n−2)|1, 8, 21, 40, 65, ...|

The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three interesting properties.

1. The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first).
2. Each polygonal type: triangle (P_{3,127}=8128), square (P_{4,91}=8281), and pentagonal (P_{5,44}=2882), is represented by a different number in the set.
3. This is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this property.

Find the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic 4-digit numbers for which each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal, is represented by a different number in the set.

# 62: Cubic permutations (TODO)
The cube, 41063625 (345^3), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: 56623104 (384^3) and 66430125 (405^3). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.

Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.

# 63: Powerful digit counts (TODO)

The 5-digit number, 16807=7^5, is also a fifth power. Similarly, the 9-digit number, 134217728=8^9, is a ninth power.

How many n-digit positive integers exist which are also an nth power?

# 64: Odd period square roots (TODO)

All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can be written in the form:

$$\quad \quad \sqrt{N}=a_0+\frac 1 {a_1+\frac 1 {a_2+ \frac 1 {a3+ \dots}}}$$

For example, let us consider $\sqrt{23}:$

$$\quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\sqrt{23}-4=4+\frac 1 {\frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}}=4+\frac 1  {1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}7}$$

If we continue we would get the following expansion:

$$\quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {3+ \frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {8+ \dots}}}}$$

The process can be summarised as follows:


$\quad \quad a_0=4, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$

$\quad \quad a_1=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$

$\quad \quad a_2=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$

$\quad \quad a_3=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)} 7=8+\sqrt{23}-4$

$\quad \quad a_4=8, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$

$\quad \quad a_5=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7 (\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$

$\quad \quad a_6=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$

$\quad \quad a_7=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)} {7}=8+\sqrt{23}-4$


It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use the notation $\sqrt{23}=[4;(1,3,1,8)]$, to indicate that the block (1,3,1,8) repeats indefinitely

The first ten continued fraction representations of (irrational) square roots are:

$\quad \quad \sqrt{2}=[1;(2)]$, period=$1$

$\quad \quad \sqrt{3}=[1;(1,2)]$, period=$2$

$\quad \quad \sqrt{5}=[2;(4)]$, period=$1$

$\quad \quad \sqrt{6}=[2;(2,4)]$, period=$2$

$\quad \quad \sqrt{7}=[2;(1,1,1,4)]$, period=$4$

$\quad \quad \sqrt{8}=[2;(1,4)]$, period=$2$

$\quad \quad \sqrt{10}=[3;(6)]$, period=$1$

$\quad \quad \sqrt{11}=[3;(3,6)]$, period=$2$

$\quad \quad \sqrt{12}=[3;(2,6)]$, period=$2$

$\quad \quad \sqrt{13}=[3;(1,1,1,1,6)]$, period=$5$

Exactly four continued fractions, for $N \le 13$, have an odd period.

How many continued fractions for $N \le 10\,000$ have an odd period?

# 65: Convergents of e (TODO)

The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.

$\sqrt{2} = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + ...}}}}$

The infinite continued fraction can be written, $\sqrt{2} = [1; (2)]$, $(2)$ indicates that 2 repeats <i>ad infinitum</i>. In a similar way, $\sqrt{23} = [4; (1, 3, 1, 8)]$.

It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for $\sqrt{2}$.

$$
1 + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{3}{2}\\
1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}} = \dfrac{7}{5}\\
1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}} = \dfrac{17}{12}\\
1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}} = \dfrac{41}{29}
$$

Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for $\sqrt{2}$ are:

$1, \dfrac{3}{2}, \dfrac{7}{5}, \dfrac{17}{12}, \dfrac{41}{29}, \dfrac{99}{70}, \dfrac{239}{169}, \dfrac{577}{408}, \dfrac{1393}{985}, \dfrac{3363}{2378}, ...$

What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,

$e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, ... , 1, 2k, 1, ...]$.

The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for <i>e</i> are:

$$2, 3, \dfrac{8}{3}, \dfrac{11}{4}, \dfrac{19}{7}, \dfrac{87}{32}, \dfrac{106}{39}, \dfrac{193}{71}, \dfrac{1264}{465}, \dfrac{1457}{536}, ...$$

The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10<sup>th</sup> convergent is $1 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 17$.

Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100<sup>th</sup> convergent of the continued fraction for $e$.

# 66: Diophantine equation (TODO)

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

x^2 – Dy^2 = 1

For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 649^2 – 13×180^2 = 1.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.

By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:

> 3^2 – 2×2^2 = 1
> 
> 2^2 – 3×1^2 = 1
>
> **9**^2 – 5×4^2 = 1
> 
> 5^2 – 6×2^2 = 1
> 
> 8^2 – 7×3^2 = 1

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D ≤ 7, the largest x is obtained when D=5.

Find the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest value of x is obtained.

# 67: Maximum path sum II
Find the maximum total from top to bottom in `p067_triangle.txt`, a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

**NOTE:** This is a much more difficult version of Problem 18. It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2^{99} altogether! If you could check one trillion (10^{12}) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)

**Solution:** Used same approach as problem 18.
